  @function read

  @param    {Stream} [stream] the stream to read from
  @desc
    This function blocks until the first `data` event is recieved
    on the stream, and returns that data. Returns `null` if the
    stream has ended.

    If stream emits `error`, the error is thrown.

    Calls `resume` on the stream before waiting for data,
    and calls `pause` on the stream after data is returned.
    This ensures that no data is emitted between calls to `read()`.

    should not be used on infinite or large streams, as it will buffer the
    entire contents in memory.

    If the data cannot be written immediately, this function

    This class is similar to StringIO in other languages,
    it allows the user to present a `String` as if it were a nodejs `Stream`.

    The stream will emit a single `data` event with the provided string. `pause()`
    and `resume()` can be used to delay this event, and `destroy()` to cancel it.
