/**
  @class EventQueue
  @summary Listens for specified events and stores them in a queue.
  @desc
     Use function [::eventQueue] to construct a new
     EventQueue object.

  @function  eventQueue
  @summary Constructs a new EventQueue object.
  @return  {::EventQueue}
  @param   {EventEmitter} [emitter] NodeJS event emitter
  @param   {String} [event] Event to listen for
  @desc
    The returned [::EventQueue] object proceeds to listen for
    events immediately in the background, and continues to do so until
    [::EventQueue::stop] is called.

    Alternatively, because [::EventQueue] implements a
    [::EventQueue::__finally__] method, it can be used in a
    `using` block:

        using (var Q = require('apollo:node-events').eventQueue(emitter, event)) {
          while (true) {
            var data = Q.get();
            ...
          }
        }

    Here the `using` construct will automatically call
    [::EventQueue::__finally__] when the `using` code
    block is exited.
